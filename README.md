# C++ plus code to generate NP's structure for PowerMEIS simulations

## Introduction

In this repository it is shown a 10,000 lines code which enables the creation of several structures of NPs as well as their pilling in order to analyze the MEIS (Medium Energy Ion Scattering) spectra.

## Content of the files: 

1. clib_mtxgen.cpp: the main code from which the structures can be formed;
2. clib_mtxgen.h: the header of the main code
3. manualmtxgen.pdf: (uncompleted) manual on how to use the code to generate structures.
